#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic approach to designing, developing, and maintaining software by applying engineering principles to ensure quality, reliability, and scalability.
It's important in the tech industry because it improves software quality, reduces costs, ensures scalability, and drives innovation.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s: High-level programming languages like Fortran and COBOL.
1970s: Structured programming for modular and readable code.
2000s: Agile methodologies for iterative development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Gathering: understanding what the client or users need from the software.
Design:Creating a blueprint for the software, including architecture, interfaces, and data models.
Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code based on the design.
Testing: Verifying that the software works as intended and meets requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or production environments.
Maintenance: Fixing bugs and updating the software as needed over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential development process where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. Example:A government contract where specifications are rigidly defined upfront.
While Agile is a An iterative and flexible approach where software is developed in small, incremental cycles (called sprints).
Ideal for projects with evolving requirements or where feedback is continuously incorporated, such as in startups or web development. Example: Developing an e-commerce website where new features and user feedback continuously shape the product.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes and maintains code, implements functionality based on the software design, and collaborates with other team members to meet project goals.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Ensures that the software meets quality standards through rigorous testing (unit, integration, and system testing) and works to identify bugs before deployment.

Project Manager: Oversees the project timeline, budget, and resources, ensuring that the team meets deadlines and that the software aligns with the stakeholders' goals.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: Software applications that provide tools for writing, testing, and debugging code in one place. IDEs streamline the development process.
Example: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.

VCS: Systems that track changes to code over time, allowing developers to collaborate, revert to previous versions, and manage code across multiple branches.
Example: Git, Subversion (SVN).



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Maintaining Code Quality: Continuous code reviews, use of coding standards, and automated testing can help maintain high-quality code.
Dealing with Changing Requirements: Using flexible methodologies like Agile allows for adaptation to changing project requirements.
Collaborating Across Teams: Effective communication tools (Slack, Microsoft Teams) and project management tools (Jira, Trello) can improve collaboration.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit: Tests individual components.
Integration: Ensures modules work together.
System: Tests the whole system.
Acceptance: Verifies software meets business needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves creating specific inputs (prompts) for AI models to elicit desired outputs. It’s an essential skill in interacting with models like GPT because well-designed prompts can drastically improve the quality, relevance, and usefulness of the responses generated.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about software."

Improved Prompt: "Explain the importance of software engineering in modern technology, and describe three key milestones in its evolution."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective: The improved prompt is more specific, guiding the AI to focus on particular aspects of software engineering (importance and evolution) instead of providing a broad, unfocused response. It’s also concise, avoiding unnecessary ambiguity.
